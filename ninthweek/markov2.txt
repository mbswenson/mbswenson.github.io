 Lanier regards the mashups of culture as something both destructive and reductive, removing true individuality and creativity. However, these mashups and constant recombinations are not particularly inherent to the present and a representation of the malaise of modern digital society. The history of design is built upon reconfiguring and iterating upon the past, developing and recombining from what has existed before. Fragmentary is described in his terms as something synonymously negative with messy, incomplete, and detached. But there is something inherently humanly individual about fragmentation.
 What does it mean to be a human and an individual in a synthetic future? According to Ghost in the Shell, it means a potential to exist without bounds. Limits are flexible, the body is flexible. The physical is merely a shell for an expansive world and ephemeral ocean of information. Everything is built from fragments, but these fragments allow for a complexity that can be lost within arbitrary confines. Lanier’s complete rejection of anonymity and mashups in all forms and assertion of focusing on existing as yourself whenever possible limits the potential and freedom inherent in the digital and synthetic.
 The Ghost in the Shell franchise is a large one, spread across a variety of mediums with a plethora of separate narrative continuities. In some stories, Major Motoko Kusanagi has no single body. She rejects the idea of a singular identity, and finds absolute freedom in the fragmentation of the self. She can always start over, and become someone or something else.  There is no longer a template for her to adhere to. Jaron Lanier, over the course of the chapter, asserts that existing without a template is a way to be a “person instead of a source of fragments to be exploited by others." A person, an identity, is entirely an assortment of fragments. Exploitation doesn’t simply end with the defragmentation of the self, but in altering the system in which it happens.
