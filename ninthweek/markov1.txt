I am in a weird transitory time in my life. Actually, I think all of life is probably a weird transitory time. In the past few weeks or so, I’ve somewhat regained a strong sense of why I make games or things in general. After making a couple of games about dark inescapable spaces bound to seemingly endless cycles and a wholesome spooky endless runner, I’m making a thing that’s about love and identity in a ghost void. I make games or things because they’re how I figure things out. In times like these, I turn to digital and abstract places to define what feels otherwise undefinable and vast. It’s always been a form of home to me, a place to craft from absence.
I’m going to do an admittedly sloppy transition here. I swear I’ll get to my point, just stick with me here. There’s a bell hooks quote that appears on my tumblr dashboard every once in awhile that I’ve found to be very true: “Contemplating death has always been a subject that leads me back to love.” I don’t know what the original context of the quote is, but I always think about it when I would morbidly think about dying during relatively mundane travel situations. Like those moments when I’m on the subway or I’m on a plane and I think “WOW I could totally die at any moment! Like right now! Like right this very second!” and it makes me think about everything and how both massive and tiny it all is.
And I always think about the people I love the most. I think that’s what those moments are really about, thinking about the connections I have with the people I care about and the world around me. So, I wanted to make something that wasn’t about abstract fears and anxieties and entrapment and terrible cycles. I wanted to make something that was about you, that was really about other people in relation to you. I wanted to make something about love within absence, in distance. The connections that can still be tangible, even when you’re not tangibly there.
